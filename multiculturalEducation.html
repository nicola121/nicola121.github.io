            <p>I made a multicultural education lesson plan below for middle school math.
                This artifact demonstrates my ability to incorporate many different perspectives and 
                cultures into my lesson planning and teaching. I want to make sure that the diversity
                of my students is valued; I plan to involve students' cultures, hobbies, and home lives
                in how I teach in the classroom because it will help the students feel valued and also 
                help each of us learn something new! 
                There are equitable opportunities for all students 
                to learn mathematics. These concepts can be found in the lesson plan below. 
                </p>
                <p>
                It's also important to focus on how math evolved through time by 
                people like us, though with many different cultural backgrounds. I really enjoyed talking 
                about fractions and how they were originially created to help people express sharing food with
                each other evenly. It makes mathematicians a little less far off and scary. </p>
