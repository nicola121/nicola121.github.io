                I have a strong desire to improve and grow as a teacher and as a person. As such, over
                the past few months, I have been making lists of attributes that I want as a teacher.
                I have also been compiling resources that I will like to use as a teacher. I have been 
                collaborating with friends, asking to use some of the resources that they have made.
                I included the list of things that I will try to incorporate into my teaching below. 
                I plan to continue adding to this list and practicing each of the principles as they come
                up in my teaching.
