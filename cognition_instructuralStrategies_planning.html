            <p>I have attatched a unit plan about triangles that shows a few lesson plans that would 
                be included in that unit. It's important to note that I've included lessons that emphasize
                different learning levels. The ones included in that unit are: construct a concept,
                simple knowledge, Comprehension and Communication, and Application. These and other learning levels
                are so important becuase they help students form ideas, discover relationships, communicate effectively
                about mathematics, apply math to real world problems, and remember better!</p>

                <p>Next, I included a Geometry Lesson that introduced Points, Lines, and Planes.
                I attatched the lesson plan and Powerpoint. These artificats also show the stages used for Construct 
                A Concept Lesson.</p>
