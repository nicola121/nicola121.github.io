            <p>	I would like my classroom to be a safe and effective learning environment for all of my students. This often means that accommodations are necessary. I am very happy to accommodate students with IEPâ€™s and 504 Plans. Additionally, I want to make sure that students without such formal documentation are also given the opportunities and accommodations that they need to do their best work and succeed. The following documentation shows my plans for implementing accommodations in the classroom. </p>
