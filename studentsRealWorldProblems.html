            <p>One summer, I was a YMCA STEM teacher. One of my favorite activities that we did 
                was teaching them how to order their favorite meals at a variety of resteraunts. I was surprised
                by how many students didn't know what a combo meal was. We then led the rest of the activity where
                we helped them learn more about fractions and dividing costs evenly amongst friends. This helped 
                the students see why math is actually important in their lives. This was an activity made for younger
                students, but the principles of creating engaging lesson plans still applies to older kids. I try
                to make my classroom activities enjoyable and relatable so they will help the students for the rest of
                their lives.
