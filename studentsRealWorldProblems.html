            <p>One summer, I was a YMCA STEM teacher. One of my favorite activities that we did 
                was teaching them how to order their favorite meals at a variety of resteraunts. I was surprised
                by how many students didn't know what a combo meal was. We then led the rest of the activity where
                we helped them learn more about fractions and dividing costs evenly amongst friends. This helped 
                the students see why math is actually important in their lives. This was an activity made for younger
                students, but the principles of creating engaging lesson plans still applies to older kids. I try
                to make my classroom activities enjoyable and relatable so they will help the students for the rest of
                their lives.

                Another activity that I would like to implement in my classroom involves interest and debt. 
                I watched a teacher discuss how the cost of a $800 washer with a certain interest rate doubled in just a few years.
                The students were shocked! It's important to teach math concepts like that in context
                of everyday life and the real world. He showed the students a amoratization schedule
                that showed how much money people are loosing each year in interest, and explained
                why it's important to be smart with the credit that you take out. It's better to get a loan
                out from the bank than to pay sometimes double the interest rate by just using your credit card.
                This helped a lot of students realize how they can avoid debt in their lives. That could be one of the 
                most important math lessons that a teacher could teach their students!
