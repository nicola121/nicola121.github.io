            <br>
            For my semester project, I will discuss how triangles and angles helped mathematicians 
            develop the unit circle.
            This semester I enjoyed finding interactive ways to explain the derivation of the unit
            circle and how it can be helpful for us today. Understanding its history and creation will 
            help students understand how to use it more effectively in the real world.
            <br><br>
            The unit circle has been around for centuries. It dates back to the 2nd millennium BC in 
            Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics. One may ask, "Why was the unit circle used way back 
            then?" or "Why is the unit circle so important?"  The purpose of this website is to explain 
            the unit circle's history, its geometric origins, and applications. Simply put, the unit 
            circle was created to reflect certain discoverable relationships and mathematical 
            principles. It allows us to easily solve for the sine, cosine, or tangent of some useful 
            angles. The unit circle is far more valuable than we often give it credit for.
            <br><br>
            One might also ask, why does it have to be a circle with a length 1? Stapel explained the 
            answer to this question well: "To simplify computations, mathematicians like to fit an 
            angle's triangle into a circle with radius r = 1. Because the number 1 is called "the unit" 
            in mathematics, a circle with a radius of length 1 is called 'the unit circle'. Once the 
            hypotenuse has a fixed length of r = 1, then the values of the trig ratios will depend only 
            on x and y, since multiplying or dividing by r = 1 won't change anything. Only the values 
            of x and y will matter" (Stapel). All the trigonometric relationships are the same no 
            matter what radius it is. However, we can see that mathematicians selected the circle with 
            radius 1 because it simplifies the amount of work to solve for x and y values. 
            <p>The unit circle is a fundamental principle that we learn in trigonometry classes because 
                it helps us understand geometric relationships, and it gives us the tools to solve far 
                more complicated problems. Whether the unit circle is used like a compass for navigators, 
                or for handyman to determine the height of a ladder, it will continue to be useful for 
                all of us for years to come.
