            <p>Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the side lengths and angles of 
                triangles. The unit circle was created to express these relationships for specific 
                triangles. The term "trigonometry" was derived from the Greek "trigonometria", meaning 
                "triangle measuring." A Greek mathematician named Hipparchus is considered to be the 
                founder of trigonometry. He was given this title because he was the first person to 
                develop a table of trigonometric chords. A chord is a line segment connecting two points 
                on a curve. Chords are important for trigonometry because they are used as another way 
                to figure out side-lengths of triangles. This was an important feat because "the problem 
                was to find the length of the chord subtended by a given angle." (O'Conner). 
                (In geometry, an angle is subtended by an arc, line segment or any other section of a 
                curve when its two rays pass through the endpoints of that arc.) Hipparchus was able 
                to discover a formula that calculates this length. The modern version of this formula 
                is: chord(x) = r(2 sin(\(\frac{x}{2}\))). He then used this knowledge to generate a 
                table with the values for the chords. Advancements like this allowed precise 
                measurements and calculations on a level unknown beforehand. 
            </p>

           <p> Trigonometry was historically developed for astronomers and geographers. The stars were 
               thought to be fixed points on a very large sphere, with only the planets moving. 
               Spherical trigonometry was used to understand the positions on a sphere. Menelaus' work 
               on spherics is the earliest known work on spherical trigonometry. Spherical trigonometry 
               is rarely taught in schools because it has been replaced with linear algebra.

            <p>
            Navigators used something called an astrolabe (that looked like a compass) to measure the 
            angle between a star and the horizon. They would consider the time of year (because stars 
            change depending on the time of year) and use a couple of reference points and a star chart 
            to determine where they were located on the earth. The astrolabe was used for measuring the 
            position of the sun and other starts to help aid in navigation.

           <p>A coordinate is specified by a combination of two angles, one north or south from the 
               equator (0 degrees), and one east or west from the prime meridian (crossing through 
               Greenwich England). This constitutes latitude and longitude. Using two perpendicular 
               lines like latitude and longitude to describe a certain point in space sounds very 
               similar to an x, y coordinate plane used by the unit circle. Each point on the unit 
               circle is described by its x and y direction, or rather, its latitude and longitude. 
               The modern compass, which was designed to help navigate these latitudinal and 
               longitudinal lines, looks like a unit circle if positioned sideways.

            <p>When the unit circle was being created, there were many factors to consider. For example, 
                what are the most important angles to show? Where should the unit circle start, and 
                should it go clockwise or counterclockwise? For navigation, they place 0 at the top of 
                the circle because that is straight ahead for them. 
                However, for the unit circle, the starting place may have been determined based on how 
                the x,y coordinate plane system was set up (causing (1,0) to be the starting coordinate).
                Regardless of how it was decided, it is convention for counterclockwise to be positive 
                in the unit circle. 
            </p>
             <p>There were many other questions, such as how many sections should a circle be divided 
                 into? We all know that it was divided into 360 sections, but why couldn't it have been 
                 divided into an easier number like 100? While there are many things about the creation 
                 of the unit circle that we don't know, there is a definitive answer for this question. 
                 Jeff Cruzan explains, "it turns out that numbers like 360&#176; and the 60-minute hour 
                 likely arose because of the convenience of using fractions of those numbers. While 100 
                 can be divided into 50ths, 10ths, and so on, 60 can be divided sections of 
                 \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{4}\), \(\frac{1}{6}\), \(\frac{1}{10}\), 
                 \(\frac{1}{12}\), and a few more convenient fractions. It made a lot of sense before 
                 the digital age" (Cruzan).
