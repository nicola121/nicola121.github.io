            <p>The unit circle has many applications in the real world. Different problems can be 
                solved easier using polar or rectangular coordinates, and the unit circle is a helpful 
                tool to transfer between the two forms. In calculus, you often need to switch between 
                rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates because derivatives are often easier to 
                solve when they are in polar coordinates (due to the nature of taking the derivative 
                of sin and cos). The following applet shows students how to convert rectangular to 
                polar coordinates in a visual manner.

            <p>The trigonometric functions sine and cosine can be directly correlated to the unit 
                circle in both their starting points and patterns of movement. As we begin at (1,0) and 
                travel along the unit circle counter-clockwise, we can graph each of the x values on a 
                cartesian plane. As we do this, we will see the cosine function appearing. If we graph 
                the y values on the cartesian plane, we will see the sine function appearing. This 
                allows us to apply the principles we learn in the unit circle to the oscillating 
                functions of sine and cosine. This is especially helpful when dealing with physical 
                applications of frequency or resonance.

            <p>Part of the main application of the unit circle is introducing students into the world 
                of trigonometric functions. Sine and cos are useful in engineering industries because 
                they are continuous functions (thereby avoiding a lot of the problems that come with 
                dealing with tangent's discontinuity. The unit circle's properties also aid students in 
                visualizing the graphs and solutions of certain trigonometric functions. A textbook 
                written by Minnesota State University faculty explains the importance of fostering 
                "students' understanding of the interrelationships among graphs, and equations..." 
                (Hornsby 2011). The unit circle helps students make key connections like these.
            </p>
            <p>The unit circle's principles are essential to understanding trigonometric identities. 
                Calculus 2 requires an in-depth understanding of the relationships of trigonometric 
                functions, and the unit circle is very helpful in solving for the correct solutions.

            <p>Another application was found using Szeg&ouml;'s theory of orthogonal polynomials on the 
                unit circle. This complicated application of the unit circle "is commonly used in 
                digital signal processing (DSP) applications to solve various least-squares problems" 
                (Dedsarte 1990). There are many other advanced implications of the unit circle. One of 
                these involves "images encoding angular information... Examples include the hue band of 
                color images, or images encoding directional texture information" (Hanbury 2001). 
                Mathematicians are trying to apply mathematical morphology to image data distributed on 
                the unit circle, though it is not immediately possible.

            One may ask, "But how does the unit circle help me in my life?" To answer, that question, 
            it's important to know that the unit circle applies to many different job fields that you 
            may consider going into. The unit circle can be used to calculate distances like the 
            heights of mountains (ranger) or how far away the stars in the sky are 
            (navigator/astronomer). The cyclic, repeated nature of trig functions means that they are 
            useful for studying different types of waves in nature: like the ocean (marine biologist, 
            oceanography fields). Although on a higher plane, calculus is used by marine biologists 
            for purposes similar to those served by algebra and trigonometry -- namely, data analysis 
            and mathematical modeling.</p>

            </p> 
            The cylindrical behavior of light, sound, and electricity require use of the unit circle 
            as well (electrical engineer, electrician, sound designer, light board designer).

                Or it might be useful knowledge if you want to cater your products to nerdy people 
                (like the picture of the unit circle clock from Zazzle lol.) There are many other 
                applications where the unit circle can be used in a job field that you may be 
                considering. Math knowledge is always a valuable asset.
