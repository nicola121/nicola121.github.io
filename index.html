            <p>Welcome. My name is Nicola Baird, and this is my webpage for my Technology for 
                Mathematics Teacher Course.</p>

        <div class="normaltext">
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am 22 years old and am studying Mathematics Education at 
                Utah State University. I will be student teaching Fall 2022. I married my high school 
                sweetheart last August. We met in debate class my freshman year of high school and 
                became fast friends. We did theatre and choir together. I am a very passionate musical 
                theatre nerd. I love everything to do with singing. In fact I studied choir education 
                for a year at Utah Valley University before I transferred to Utah State University 
                last year. I play the piano, flute, and organ. I love playing board games with my 
                family. I have 3 nephews and 2 nieces and they are adorable.

                I added a new feature than what we learned in class. I made the menu in the top left 
                clickable to open a panel to select which pages to go to. This is the link to the 
                video we will be using for class that talks about animation and geometric 
                transformation.
