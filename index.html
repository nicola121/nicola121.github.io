            <p>Welcome. My name is Nicola Baird, and this is my webpage portfolio.</p>

        <div class="normaltext">
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am 22 years old and am studying Mathematics Education at 
                Utah State University. I will be student teaching Fall 2022. I am also getting a minor in music. 
                I am a very passionate musical theatre nerd! I love everything to do with singing.
                 In fact I studied choir education 
                for a year at Utah Valley University before I transferred to Utah State University. 
                While I was at Utah Valley University, I was also tutored math in the math lab. I enjoyed
                learning how to simplify complicated college math so students could understand the material better.
                I also enjoyed working as an orientation leader, teaching students how to be successful in school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp                   I am currently the manager over tutors at Mountain Crest High School. I absolutely love helping students
                gain the confidence they need in order to succeed. Teaching students to 
                believe that they can succeed is one of the most influential things we do to help them.
                As a math teacher, I want to help students gain growth mindsets so they can overcome
                any obstacles they face. I am passionate about using math to help students gain important life skills.
                Making math applicable to students' lives is a challenge, but it is so rewarding!

                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI play the piano, flute, and organ. I love playing board games with my 
                family. I married my high school 
                sweetheart almost two years ago. I have 3 nephews and 2 nieces and they are adorable.
